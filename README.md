# ModuleChallenge1

This is the first challenge I attempted for a grade in the DU Bootcamp.

Unfortunately I ran into many setbacks. One of which being I did not have the images used in the code. I tried to get the images off the internet. While they were not hard to find, they were not sized correctly, so any attempt to change 1 out of the 7 images would ruin the rest of the page. I apologize for submitting incomplete work, I would greatly appreciate the oppurtunity to do it over.
